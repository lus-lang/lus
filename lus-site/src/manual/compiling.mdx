title: Compiling Lus
---

Compiling Lus is a straightforward process. You will need the following tools to compile the runtime:

- The Lus source code, which can be downloaded from its [repository](https://github.com/lus-lang/lus).
- A C compiler ([gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) recommended).
- The [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/).
- OpenSSL development libraries (for HTTPS support)
- c-ares development libraries (for async DNS)

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install openssl c-ares

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libssl-dev libc-ares-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install openssl-devel c-ares-devel

# Windows (vcpkg)
vcpkg install openssl c-ares
```

After downloading and extracting the source code, navigate to the `/lus` directory and run the following commands to prepare, compile, and execute the runtime:

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build

# On macOS and Linux.
./build/lus

# On Windows.
build\lus.exe
```

The binary will be placed in the `build` directory and is ready to be used without any further configuration. Generally, you will want to place it in a directory that is in your system's `PATH` so you can invoke it from the command line anywhere:

- On macOS and Linux, you can place it in the `/usr/local/bin` directory.
- On Windows, you should create a new directory for Lus and [follow these instructions](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)#to-add-a-path-to-the-path-environment-variable>) to add it to your system's `PATH`.
