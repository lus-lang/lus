## As a runtime

Lus is a runtime that possesses everything needed to run and develop programs. It can be downloaded as a binary from the [homepage](/), or you can download the source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loukamb/lus) and compile it yourself. Instructions on compiling the runtime can be found [here](/manual/compiling).

When downloaded, the runtime is a single binary file that can be executed directly to start a REPL:

```bash
./lus
```

Pass a file path to the runtime to execute a Lus program:

```bash
./lus my-program.lus
```

## As a library

Lus and its C API can also be used as an embedded scripting language for your software.
