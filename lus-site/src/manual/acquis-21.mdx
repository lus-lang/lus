title: Acquis 21 - String Interpolation
acquis: true

String interpolation allows for the dynamic construction of strings by interpolating values into a template, which may be more intuitive than concatenation.

## Syntax

Backticks are used to open and close interpolated strings.

```lus
print(`Hello, world!`)
```

Variables can be interpolated using the `$name` syntax, while expressions use the `$(expr)` syntax.

```lus
local x = "world"
print(`Hello, $x!`)
print(`The answer is $(10 + 20).`)
```

Interpolated strings can include newlines.

```lus
local x = "world"
print(`
Hello, $x!
The answer is $(10 + 20).
`)
```

## Semantics

Values in interpolated strings are converted using the same mechanism as `print` and `tostring`. If you have a table with a `__tostring` metamethod, it will be invoked to retrieve the string representation of the table.
