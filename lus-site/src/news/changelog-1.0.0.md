# Lus 1.0.0

Lus 1.0.0 is the **first major release** of the language.

> This changelog denotes differences between Lus and Lua 5.5 RC 2. Lua 5.5 most (in)famously introduces the `global` assignment statement; it is not a Lus-specific feature.

- Added table deconstruction with `from` assignment.
- Added scoped assignments in `if`/`elseif` conditionals.
- Added `catch` expression for error handling in expressions.
- Added optional chaining with the `?` suffix operator.
- Added first-class enums with the `enum` keyword.
- Added `os.platform` function that returns the platform name.
- Added support for WebAssembly builds.
- Added pre-built test suites in four harnesses.
- Removed `pcall` and `xpcall` in favor of `catch`.
- Upgraded the build system from `make` to `meson`.
